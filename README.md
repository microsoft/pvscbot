[![CI](https://github.com/microsoft/pvscbot/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push "CI status badge")](https://github.com/microsoft/pvscbot/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush+workflow%3ACI)

# Purpose

This bot exists to automate the development process/workflow for
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python. It also acts as a simple demo of
a GitHub bot running on Azure.

This bot is what is known as an OAuth app and is not a GitHub app. The
[differences](https://developer.github.com/apps/differences-between-apps/) come
down to simplicity in authentication and how widely can the bot be deployed. Since
this bot is only deployed for a single repository and the original author was
intimately familiar with OAuth apps that was the route taken.

This bot also predates [GitHub Actions](https://developer.github.com/actions/)
being released. As such some things this bot does may be easier to do as an action.

Currently the bot will do the following things for you:

1. Add/remove the `classify` label based on whether any other status label is set.
1. When an issue is closed, remove any status-related labels, e.g. `needs PR`
   (with the idea that if an issue is re-opened then it needs to be re-evaluated
   as to why the issue is still open).
1. Require a pull request has a news file entry in `news` **or** have a `skip news`
   label.

# Deployment

## Generically

### On the deployment/hosting side

You must set two environment variables for the bot to function:

1. `GH_SECRET`: [secret between GitHub and your bot](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/#setting-your-secret-token).
1. `GH_AUTH`: [Auth token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) for the bot to make changes in your repo.

The [shared secret](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/#setting-your-secret-token)
between GitHub and your bot is used to verify that the webhook payload actually
originated from GitHub for your repository and isn't malicious. This is important
as a malicious user could send fake webhook payloads to your bot and cause it to
make changes on the malicious user's behalf.

The [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
is to empower your bot to make changes to your repo on your behalf. You can use
a token from your personal GitHub account or create a fake bot account. Make sure
the token has the following scopes/permissions:

1.`repo:public_repo` (if your repo is public; adjust accordingly for your needs)

### On the GitHub side

When [creating the webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/) you
need to specify what events to send to your endpoint. This bot supports the
following events:

1. `Issues`
1. `Pull Requests`

## Azure

The bot is currently written to support
[Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/)
running on Python 3.7.
